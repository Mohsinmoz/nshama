        Nshama unveils 'Town Square,' the city’s first-of-its-kind urban metropolis offering unmatched value
       </h4>
       <p>
        Nshama, a private developer of integrated lifestyle communities differentiated by a focus on offering distinct value propositions for aspiring home-owners, is unveiling the first-of-its-kind and largest town square development in Dubai. 
       </p>
       <p>
        Celebrating a welcoming outdoor lifestyle that promotes the wellness of residents in a vibrant, unique and trendy development, the soon-to-be-launched Town Square redefines the concept of integrated neighbourhoods in the city. With all amenities in walking distance, it showcases the best of everything that Dubai has to offer in one inspiring community development like no other. 
       </p>
       <p>
        To drive the development of Town Square, as well as other projects in the pipeline, Nshama has appointed its strategic leadership team comprising veteran professionals who bring over 100 years of collective experience in Dubai and internationally. Led by Chief Executive Officer Fred Durie and Chief Operations Officer Abubakr Sidahmed, among the masterminds behind prestigious landmarks such as Downtown Dubai, Dubai Marina, Arabian Ranches and Emirates Living, the team will craft a new dimension in an integrated community development that transforms the lives of residents. 
       </p>
       <p>
        Spread over about 750 acres, Town Square brings a new suburban downtown residential destination with its mix of 3 and 4-bedroom townhouses and mid-rises with 1, 2 and 3-bedroom apartments offering tremendous value across all touch-points. A smart, sustainable and connected community, it focuses on promoting an active outdoor lifestyle, as well as arts and culture. A central park and wide open green spaces add to the quality of life of residents assuring them a refreshing getaway. 
       </p>
       <p>
        Fred Durie said: "Nshama is ushering in a new development approach to Dubai that draws on the Dubai Plan 2021 and supports the key theme of establishing the city as a 'preferred place to live, work and visit.’ Focused on end-users, particularly families and young people who cherish an active outdoor lifestyle, our new project brings the novel concept of a modern town square to Dubai. 
       </p>
       <p>
        "Meeting the demand for value homes from professionals and families along the city’s major growth corridor, Town Square distinguishes itself across all aspects of its design, development and after-sales service. It also meets the significant demand for middle-income value housing with quality and affordable price points as our prime consideration."
       </p>
       <p>
        He added: "Town Square is a smart, intelligent community that meets the aspirations of the young, trendy and value-conscious customer, enabling them to shift from a rent-based lifestyle to homes that provide them a sense of belonging. All our projects are similarly planned to meet the growing middle-income demand for end-user homes, led by our vision to bring a new lifestyle choice to Dubai that transforms the lives of people."
       </p>
       <p>
        Town Square will feature over 3,000 townhouses and 18,000 apartments in addition to substantial retail, hospitality and commercial space. The masterplan also envisages a central and vibrant hub with shopping and dining districts, plazas, greenbelts, mosques, educational institutions, healthcare centres, entertainment and outdoor sports facilities. With a total land area of 31 million sq ft, it will have a high land-to-building ratio, thus opening up more open spaces for a greener community. 
       </p>
       <p>
        Town Square will be defined by elegant landscaping by world-renowned urban and landscape architects. Natural and paved running tracks crisscross the development, which will feature outdoor gymnasiums, skateboard parks, children’s play areas, relaxing green spaces, community swimming pools and access to cycle tracks that complement the popular Al Qudra cycle track.   
       </p>

       <p>
        Setting a new precedent in value developments, Town Square is centrally located in New Dubai near Al Barsha, in easy proximity to popular malls as well as the Al Maktoum International Airport, which is less than 20 minutes away. It is picturesquely designed on the lines of trendy lifestyle centres that exude positivity and a vibrant outdoor lifestyle.
       </p>
       <p>
        Complementing the multicultural population of the city, Town Square will have a wide array of F&B outlets that meet all tastes and preferences – from trendy cafes for friendly get-togethers to family dine-in outlets. Several international and high-street brands will have their presence in the neighbourhood in addition to a choice of leisure attractions. 
       </p>
       <p>
        The development of Town Square will benefit from the leadership team at Nshama with deep expertise in delivering thoughtfully designed destinations and neighbourhoods that reflect the needs and aspirations of the new generation.
       </p>
