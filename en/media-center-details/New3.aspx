                            Dubai, UAE; March 3, 2015: Nshama, a private developer of integrated lifestyle communities offering 
distinct value propositions for aspiring home-owners, has joined hands with Vida Hotels and Resorts, the 
new generation hotel brand of Emaar Hospitality Group, to operate a lifestyle boutique Vida hotel and 
serviced residences in Town Square, Nshama’s flagship development that spans an area of 750 acres.
The agreement was signed by Fred Durie, Chief Executive Officer of Nshama, and Philippe Zuber, Chief 
Operating Officer of Emaar Hospitality Group.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Embracing warmth, simplicity and youthful vitality, Vida Town Square Dubai will serve as a smart urban 
hub where inspiring minds stay, play and connect. With 180 hotel rooms and serviced residences, it will 
be defined by its location overlooking the central park, the size of 16 football fields, and in easy access 
to a world-class retail precinct spread over 2.5 million sq ft with over 600 retail outlets as well as a 
dedicated Reel Cinemas Cineplex, educational institutions, healthcare facilities, cycling tracks and green

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fred Durie said: “Vida Hotels and Resorts shares the same values as Nshama in providing an 
unmatched lifestyle choice that meets the requirements of the new generation of tech-savvy youth 
and entrepreneurs. As the first hospitality project in Town Square, our suburban downtown residential 
destination where aspiring home-owners can live life at their price, Vida will bring youthfulness, vitality 
and positive energy that complement the aspirations of our residents. Through the partnership, we 
are focused on creating a dynamic ‘town square’ that celebrates life and offers value across all touch 
points.”

                            Philippe Zuber added: “In a short span of time, Vida Hotels and Resorts has differentiated its credentials 
in the hospitality sector by creating a new niche that challenges all industry norms. Bringing inspiring 
simplicity and intuitive style, Vida is approachable, fun and unpretentious – traits that the new 
generation values. Vida Town Square Dubai will serve as a lively hub where refreshingly new experiences 
are created. It also underlines the expansion of the brand, building its credentials as the ‘go-to’ 
hospitality offering for the young and trendy.”

fashion-forward interior concepts. It will draw on the breathtaking greenery of Town Square by 
providing vast open spaces that exude natural light, lending vitality and vigour. An array of innovative 
and value-added services await guests at the hotel including smart technologies that enable them to

                            Launched recently, Town Square is centrally located in New Dubai near Al Barsha, in easy proximity to 
popular malls as well as the Al Maktoum International Airport, which is less than 20 minutes away. A 
smart, sustainable and connected community, it focuses on promoting an active outdoor lifestyle. 
In all, Town Square, an integrated development, will feature over 3,000 townhouses and 18,000

Vida, meaning ‘life’ in Spanish, embraces warmth, simplicity and youthful vitality. The hotels create a 
stimulating environment for the younger generation who demands all the frills of modern luxury travel
