 <strong>Dubai, UAE; March 4, 2015:</strong> Dubai's first bespoke ‘town square' development is redefining the city's property sector by bringing unmatched value and competitive pricing for end-users through its first showcase of elegant townhouses within a stylishly designed, green and smart neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>
 Nshama, a private developer of integrated lifestyle communities, is offering aspiring home-owners their ‘dream residence' in Dubai at affordable touchpoints that will surpass all their expectations with the launch of Zahra Townhouses, the first residential community in its flagship ‘Town Square.' An innovative approach to property development, Nshama's Town Square is spread over 750 acres, with a central square that spans the area of 16 football fields, and features the best of everything that Dubai has to offer in one inspiring neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>
 Zahra Townhouses is the first residential phase in Town Square, and offer the choice of 3 and 4-bedroom homes starting at AED 999,888. Nshama has joined hands with three leading financial institutions – Noor Bank, First Gulf Bank and ADIB – for home finance services, further adding to the convenience of potential owners.
</p>
<p>
 Fred Durie, Chief Executive Officer of Nshama, said: "Zahra Townhouses in Town Square are like no other in the city, providing unmatched affordability through the refreshing new ‘town square' lifestyle we are bringing to Dubai. A concept never been tried before in Dubai, we are bringing world-class design, efficient after-sales service and a wide range of amenities including more than 350 retail outlets, cafés and restaurants as part of the central square, all  in one smart and sustainable neighbourhood."

<p>
 He added: "For individuals or families, in fact anyone seeking to own a home in one of Dubai's central locations, in close proximity to the World Expo 2020 site, and in a trendy neighbourhood will find the value that we deliver with Zahra Townhouses truly unbeatable. Zahra has been launched after careful market evaluation; we have identified a strong need from a large segment of the population, who aspire to be home-owners. We are providing them a choice that balances price with aesthetics, location and amenities."
</p>
<p>
 Zahra Townhouses are distinguished by spectacular green landscaping set around the community. A green trail runs throughout the neighbourhood bringing a serene and soothing calmness. Acres of parks with water features, jogging and cycling tracks, as well as state-of-the-art healthcare facilities, swimming pools, outdoor gymnasiums, skateboard parks and children's play areas promote healthy living. Residents will also have easy access to schools within walking distance and to the popular Al Qudra cycle track. 
</p>
<p>
 With efficient lay-outs that take into consideration the day-to-day needs of residents, Zahra Townhouses are smartly planned with three-bedroom townhouses ranging in size from 200 to 208 sq m, while four-bedrooms are at 225 sq m. All units have balconies with most of them opening to the green vistas enveloping the community.
</p>
<p>
 The townhouses also have a private rear garden, room for domestic help, open bistro kitchen layout, storage utility areas and covered garage. In-built cupboards, high quality fixtures and finishes are standard across all homes, which also have high-speed fibre-optic data connectivity. 
</p>
<p>
 Town Square will feature over 3,000 townhouses and 18,000 apartments as well as substantial retail, hospitality and commercial space. The masterplan envisages a central hub with over 600 shops, cafés, restaurants, a shaded public plaza, greenbelts, mosques, educational institutions, healthcare centres, entertainment and outdoor sports facilities. With a total land area of 31 million sq ft, it will have a high land-to-building ratio, thus opening up more open spaces for a greener community. Nshama will roll out the other residential components, including Zahra Apartments featuring 1, 2 and 3-bedrooms shortly.
